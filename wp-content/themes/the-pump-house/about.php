            Thanks to the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board, we have been lucky to have some gorgeous enhancements to
            our
            already-gorgeous building!
            The front of the theatre is looking dreamy with some new doors – a definite upgrade from the last ones
            with a stunning caramel tint that really suits our brick aesthetic. The old doors had a bit of a leak
            and
            were slowly rotting away… so we are very grateful for the new doors!
