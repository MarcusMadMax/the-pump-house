                <p class="section-description">Maintaining the PumpHouse Theatre building and ensuring it is
                    safe for people to use is an ongoing responsibility. Some of this work requires major
                    project funding with fundraising efforts, grant applications and Auckland Council support
                    all needed to achieve our goals..</p>

                <p class="service-description">We are excited to be moving forward with our project to install a
                    canopy over the courtyard at The PumpHouse Theatre. The canopy will provide weather
                    protection for patrons using the bathroom facilities, somewhere sheltered for children to
                    eat their lunch after a show, and a space to host gala functions which overlooks the
                    beautiful Lake Pupuke. We have partnered with Shade Systems to design and build the canopy,
                    along with Dave Pearson Architects who have ensured the design compliments the existing
                    buildingâ€™s heritage architecture. We wanted a solution that was affordable, easy to maintain
                    and with a construction timeline that minimised disruption to the theatre. The Trust Board
                    have considered several options before settling on our preferred concept designed by Shade
                    Systems. We were impressed with the Shade Systems proposal and their enthusiasm for The
                    PumpHouse and for designing a custom solution that worked within the existing structures. We
                    have the support of the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board, Auckland Council and Heritage New
                    Zealand, and have obtained the necessary consents to begin construction.</p>
                <h4 class="service-title">OUR BUDGET</h4>
                <p class="service-description">
                    Our goal is to raise a modest $60,000 to complete construction and associated improvements
                    to landscaping and lighting. Thanks to a generous grant from the Becroft Foundation we have
                    already funded approximately $12,000 for Heritage Impact assessments, Heritage Architects,
                    and resources consents.
